  p-convolution are proposed, while circumventing its principal drawbacks, and
  their capacity to efficiently learn grayscale morphological operators while
  raising several edge cases is showcased"

  type: "report"
  tldr: "Image processing is a very broad field of study that encompasses a
multitude of operations, each of them
with different purposes and circumstances of use, complexities and results.
Nowadays, the bests results
for automatic image study (image segmentation, image classification, object
        detection, etc.) are obtained
using deep learning, and more specifically convolutional neural networks. We
explore and conduct experiments on a specific part of image processing,
mathematical morphology, investigating on the best way of
circumventing operationsâ€™ complexities regarding their integration in a
supervised learning pipeline.

- title: "Survey on Convolutional Neural Networks and Pooling Strategies"
  date: 05-07-2021
  tldr: "When talking about object detection, image analysis, image
classification and
essentially every algorithm that tries to apply the conveniences of deep
learning and back-propagation in signal related fields, Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) appear to be the best contenders. Throughout the years, many
variants were proposed with architectures and layer arrangements very peculiar
and different, but also diverse pooling/sub-sampling methods, which
CNNs heavily rely on to increase invariance to distortions and have a broader
feature detection. In this paper, we overview the structure of Neural Networks
and Convolutional Neural Networks, review the existing approaches of
pooling layers and present possible future directions."
