## Subject

For this course project, the goal was to do something with a personal
implementation of a [ray tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)).

My base implementation was able to render objects in space like those spheres:

## Project

I decided to implement the support of [height
maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap#:~:text=In%20computer%20graphics%2C%20a%20heightmap,display%20in%203D%20computer%20graphics.),
by creating them randomly with a
[diamond-square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm)
algorithm and discretizing their complex form into smaller ones (triangles) to
ease the ray tracing process.

This pipeline can give this kind of output:

## Performances Enhancement

The problem for creating visualy attractive maps, is that a lot of triangles are
required, and therefore the computation time increases a lot. To counter this, I
found a trick to ignore most of the triangles during the ray tracing process.

I decided to consider maps as a cuboids:

Then, the cuboid could act as a hitbox and give interesting informations on the
ray that was launched during calculations, esentially where it was entering and
exiting the cuboid:

In the end, it reduces the number of triangles to check when searching which
objects in the scene get intersected by the launched ray of light.

I did some benchmarks, which showed that this method was indeed speeding up the
computation process:

## Final Results

Finally, I was able to have those results, with maps containing millions of
triangles:
