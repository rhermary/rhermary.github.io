Keywords : Image processing, Image Detection


The goal of this project was to find an algorithms pipeline that would get the
venation intersection detected. Microscopic images and some ground truth were
given, but purposely not enough not for deep learning to be used.

> Here are a sample of given pictures with their ground truth

- Sato filter to highlight the venation
- Enhance and select highlighted venation with morphology
- Morphological reconstruction
- Skeletonize the result to ease corner detection

> Results at each step of the pipeline

- Corner detection with Harris corner detector
- Postprocessing to remove points too close from eachother (avoid duplicates)

> Result of raw corner detection and after post processing

> Final results for the 5 pictures with ground truth. The calculated average F-Score
> is 0.809
