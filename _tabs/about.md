## Me

Hi, I am Romain, a research student at [EPITA](https://epita.fr/en) (engineering school in computer
intelligence).

Studying computer science and engineering since 2017, I decided to specialize
in computer vision and machine learning for my last year at school. At the same
time, I chose to join a second curriculum that would introduce me to the world
of research, giving me the chance to have courses on research related topics,
and a subject to work on while being supervised by teachers-researchers.

I am currently in my end-of-studies internship, working as a machine learning
engineer at [ZEISS Microscopy](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/int/home.html)
in Munich, Germany. I am part of the team developing the algorithms and the
structure of the [APEER](https://apeer.com/machinelearning) deep learning
pipeline. This platform has its focus on microscopic image processing,
proposing cloud-based solutions for the latter. In particular, they
have an annotation tool and trainable neural network models handling partial
annotation of the data.

After the end of this internship, I intend to continue on towards a PhD on image
processing and deep learning algorithms. I'd specifically love to work on
scientific subjects, involving me to practice and improve my math and physic skills.

my LinkedIn, e-mail, etc. are at the bottom of the sidebar.

## This Site

I try to aggregate all the work I do, it is mostly school work, projects,
reports, presentations... Please browse around or use the search bar (I usually
write keywords in the posts to ease this process).

I only recently started to put up this site, posts are not as pretty,
documented, and complete as they could be but I am working on it. Feel free to
contact me if you see improvements that could be done or have questions about
a topic.

## Worth Seeing

As I am more interested in pursuing in a research oriented career, the work I
want to put forward is the [report]({% post_url 2021-07-15-seminar_report %})
I wrote on my past semester research project, and the [article]({% post_url 2021-09-20-jmiv %})
(**Learning Grayscale Mathematical Morphology with Smooth Morphological Layers**)
that I submitted to the [Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision](https://www.springer.com/journal/10851)
in July 2021. This article has been accepted and published in May 2022, it 
can be find on the [Spinger Nature](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-022-01091-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=1a3cd712-4a95-43eb-87c6-5e20380959b0)
website and also on [Research
Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360606987_Learning_Grayscale_Mathematical_Morphology_with_Smooth_Morphological_Layers),
