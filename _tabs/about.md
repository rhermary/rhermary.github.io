# Hi, I am Romain

Currently, I am starting my PhD Studies in the ___Computer Vision, Imaging & Machine
Intelligence Research Group___ ([CVIÂ²](https://cvi2.uni.lu/)), of the **University of
Luxembourg**. My research will be oriented towards anomaly detection, mostly on
images from different modalities.


I did my studies at [EPITA](https://epita.fr/en), a French engineering school
in computer intelligence, and ended up my studies as a research student in the
school's research laboratory ([LRE](https://www.lre.epita.fr/), previously LRDE).

From 2017 to 2022 I studied computer science and engineering, and decided to
specialize in **computer vision and machine learning** for my last year at school.
At the same time, I chose to join a second curriculum that would introduce me to
the world of research, giving me the chance to have courses on research related
topics, and a subject to work on while being supervised by teachers-researchers.

I finished my master studies with an internship, working as a **machine learning
engineer** at [ZEISS Microscopy](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/int/home.html)
in Munich, Germany. I was part of the team developing the algorithms and the
structure of the [APEER](https://apeer.com/machinelearning) deep learning
pipeline. This platform has its focus on microscopic image processing,
proposing cloud-based solutions for the latter. In particular, they
have an annotation tool and trainable neural network models handling partial
annotation of the data.

You can find my latest resume at [this permalink](https://hermary.eu/cv). The
links to my LinkedIn, e-mail, etc. are at the bottom of the sidebar.

## This Site

I try to aggregate all the work I do, for now it is mostly school work, projects,
reports, and presentations. Please browse around or use the search bar (I usually
write keywords in the posts to ease this process).

I will be writing posts on various topics, I find it a great way to learn and
remember what I found interesting and/or useful for my studies.

There will always be room for improvements; posts are never enough complete,
documented or illustrated, and I will always seek to do better. Feel free to
contact me if you have any suggestions or questions about a topic.

## Worth Seeing

See my latest --and for now only-- [article]({% post_url 2021-09-20-jmiv %})
(**Learning Grayscale Mathematical Morphology with Smooth Morphological Layers**)
that I submitted to the [Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision](https://www.springer.com/journal/10851)
in July 2021; it was accepted and published in May 2022, and can be find on the
[Springer Nature](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-022-01091-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=1a3cd712-4a95-43eb-87c6-5e20380959b0)
