## Me

Hi, I am Romain, a research student at [EPITA](https://epita.fr/en) (engineering school in computer
intelligence).

Studying computer science and engineering since 2017, I decided to specialize
in computer vision and machine learning for my last year at school. At the same
time, I chose to join a second curriculum that would introduce me to the world
of research, giving me the chance to have courses on research related topics,
and a subject to work on while being supervised by teachers-researchers.

I am currently searching for an end-of-studies internship, from mid-february or
after, and for 6 months. I would be interested in joining a research team to work
on image processing algorithms (potentially, linked with deep learning).
An opportunity with a company or a university in Germany would be my first
choice, and if the intership can lead to a thesis proposal that would be
perfect, as I intend to continue on towards a PhD.

You can find my resume in french [here](), and [here]() in english. The links to
my LinkedIn, e-mail, etc. are at the bottom of the sidebar.

## This Site

I try to agregate all the work I do, it is mostly school work, projects,
reports, presentations... A great part of the files are organized following the
courses they are linked to, for better structuring; if you are not familiar
with any of the categories you can browse around (there are descriptions for
each category if you click on it) or use the search bar (I usually write keywords
in the posts to ease this process).
