title: "Integration of Morphological Operators in Neural Networks"
date: 01-07-2021
type: "report"
tldr: "Image processing is a very broad field of study that encompasses a
multitude of operations, each of them
with different purposes and circumstances of use, complexities and results.
Nowadays, the bests results
for automatic image study (image segmentation, image classification, object
      detection, etc.) are obtained
using deep learning, and more specifically convolutional neural networks. We
explore and conduct experiments on a specific part of image processing,
mathematical morphology, investigating on the best way of
circumventing operationsâ€™ complexities regarding their integration in a
supervised learning pipeline.
