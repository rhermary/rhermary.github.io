title: "Survey on Convolutional Neural Networks and Pooling Strategies"
date: 05-07-2021
tldr: "When talking about object detection, image analysis, image
classification and
essentially every algorithm that tries to apply the conveniences of deep
learning and back-propagation in signal related fields, Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) appear to be the best contenders. Throughout the years, many
variants were proposed with architectures and layer arrangements very peculiar
and different, but also diverse pooling/sub-sampling methods, which
CNNs heavily rely on to increase invariance to distortions and have a broader
feature detection. In this paper, we overview the structure of Neural Networks
and Convolutional Neural Networks, review the existing approaches of
pooling layers and present possible future directions."
